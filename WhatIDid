I added a new piece and a new player:

My new piece is called BombAssassin:
BombAssassin 
  cannot capture pieces or move like a normal piece
  can only move by killing a friendly unit and stealing its location
  can self destruct killing all units around it (including itself and teammates)
  
My new player is called Murderer
  Murderer chooses moves that kill the most enemy players, and leave the most of your players alive (so the bomb assassin doesn't blow up all your dudes)
